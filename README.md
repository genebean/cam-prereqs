cam-prereqs
===========

This program is intended to simplify the installation of
Sun / Oracle Common Array Manager (CAM). In particular, it ensures that the
i686 version of some programs are installed as CAM will only work when they
are present, even on x86_64 systems.

This software is released under a BSD 3-clause licence which is detailed in the 
included LICENSE file.

All changes are noted in the changelog section of cam-prereqs.spec.
